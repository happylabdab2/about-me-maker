# About Me Page Designer

This project is an interactive web application that helps users design and preview a stylish "About Me" page. The application provides a form to enter personal details, which generates a live preview with stylish animations and interactive elements. It also includes options for custom contact links, confetti effects, and the ability to download the generated profile page as an HTML file.

## Features

- **Form-Based Profile Creation**: Users can fill out a form with their name, bio, unique value proposition, skills, personal story, and social media links.
- **Animated Scroll Sections**: Each section of the preview appears with a fade-in animation as you scroll.
- **Contact Button with Confetti Effect**: A customizable "Contact Me" button that displays a confetti effect when clicked.
- **Downloadable Profile**: Users can download their generated profile as an HTML file.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Instant preview updates as users enter their information.

## Demo

A live preview of the "About Me" page will appear as soon as you start entering details in the form. The preview includes sections for the headshot, bio, unique value proposition, skills, story, and a "Contact Me" button that shows a confetti animation when clicked.
